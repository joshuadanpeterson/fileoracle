# FileOracle

**FileOracle** is an intelligent file assistant that leverages LLM-powered retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to search, summarize, and reason across your local and cloud documents. Integrated with Alfred/Raycast, it transforms your files into a dynamic, queryable knowledge base.

## Features

- **Local File Search:** Quickly search your documents using ripgrep.
- **File Extraction:** Supports TXT, Markdown, PDF, DOCX, and more.
- **RAG Pipeline:** Query across multiple documents with the system synthesizing and reasoning over aggregated context.
- **Citation Management:** Automatically attach metadata to provide transparent sources for every answer.
- **Google Integration (Optional):** Read and process files from Google Docs and Google Drive.
- **Alfred/Raycast Integration:** Access your assistant seamlessly through your favorite Mac launcher.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Graphviz** (if you wish to render flowcharts in the terminal)
- **Git**

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FileOracle.git
   cd FileOracle
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash

   # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up API Keys and Credentials:**

   - **OpenAI:**  
     Set your API key in an environment variable:
     ```bash
     export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
     ```
   - **Google Integration (Optional):**  
     Follow the instructions in `google_integration.py` to set up OAuth credentials for accessing Google Docs/Drive.

## Usage

### Running FileOracle

To start querying your documents, run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to:
- Search for files,
- Extract text from selected documents,
- Ask questions or request summaries using the LLM,
- View answers along with citations for the sources used.

### Integrating with Alfred/Raycast

Customize `alfred_integration.py` to create an Alfred Workflow or a Raycast extension. This will allow you to trigger FileOracle directly from your launcher with custom hotkeys and commands.
